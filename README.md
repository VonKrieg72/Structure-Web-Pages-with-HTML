## An Introduction to Wireframing

### What is a Wireframe

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers, which allows them to define, and plan a basic or rough sketch of a website, app or product, and the information hierarchy of their design. Before anything is built using code, you have to know where all the information is going to go, and how users are going to interact with your interface, through where you decide to position things, such as buttons, menus, pictures, and links on the diagrams. Wireframing enables you to plan the layout and interaction of your interface, without the distractions of colors, typeface choices, or text. 

### Wireframe Examples

How you design your wireframe is up to you, whether you decide to draw it by hand with pen and paper, or whether you decide to use software on your computer. So, before you start designing your own wireframe, it's a good idea to take a look at some wireframe examples, doing so will give you some ideas and inspiration for your own wireframes, the many variety of ways to create them, and which method you are the most comfortable with. However, beginners should keep in mind that, when designing a wireframe by drawing on paper or on a board, you have the advantage of being able to make changes more easily, and you'll pay more attention to detail later on when you switch to software. 

### Things to Consider Before You Start Wireframing

UX designers approach wireframing in different ways. Whether the decision is made to draw it by hand, or use online apps or tools, it's going to be more related to what approach the particular situation requires, as opposed to what the UX designer's preference is. What the situation requires is going to depend on how much emphasis there is on visual design of the project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what's being designed. If the task is little and the visual design has been either decided upon or is not that imortant, then it's fine to go from sketch to code. However, if the time, resources and business value are all high, then it's a good idea to make a high quality and high definition wireframe, and put it through a cycle of testing, before getting your final product.

## Six Steps to Make a Wireframe

### Do Your Research

It's important to keep in mind that UX Design is a process, and wireframing will not be your first step in the process, so before you start drawing out your wireframe by hand, it's important to have these two steps covered first: *understanding who your audience is by conducting research, detailing requirements, creating user personas, and defining use cases, also you would want to compliment this by conducting more industry and competitor research.* To briefly explain what this means, it means looking at and doing a deep analysis of product lines, that are similar to what you're trying to create, looking deeper into prevailing UX trends and best practices, and reviewing you own internal design guidelines. In the event that you happen to be designing a new feature, It would be a good idea to do some research outside of your domain, such as looking at other apps and getting some creative ideas from different fields of expertise, and where they intersect with yours. 

## Prepare Your Research for Quick Reference

During the course of your research, you are going to come across a lot of information, some of it is going to be useful and some of it will not be useful, and you're not going to be able to retain all of it. So, it would be a good idea to come up with a quick reference guide or a cheat sheet, with your business and user goals, your personas, use cases, and some of the coolest features you came across in your competitor's reasearch. Also, keep in mind a few choice quotes from your audience, which will help you focus your attention on user experience, which is never forget what you're designing.   

### Make Sure You Have Your User Flow Mapped Out

It's very important to have an idea of how many screens you'll need to produce, and the flow you expect the user to follow; otherwise, your wireframing is going to get very messy very quickly. It's also important to have a very firm concept of where your users are coming from (which marketing channel and off the back of what messaging), and where you need them to end up. Being well versed in UX Vocabulary, will familiarize you with terms such as user flows and information architecture. Good information architecture will ensure that your users are self sufficient (they won't call customer service with questions about something that is very simple), less frustrated with your product (this will build trust and a good relationship), and lower drop off and drop out rates. This will mean more business and more revenue for you. 

### Draft, Don't Draw. Sketch, Don't Illustrate

At this point, after completing the previous steps, you can now start putting your ideas down on paper. It's important to mention that you shouldn't worry about colors or aesthetics, leave it to your UI designer to deal with that, or if you happen to be the designer as well, then just leave that task for later. At this point, you are outlining and representing features and formats, not illustrating in fine detail. It would be a good idea, to sketch your ideas down with a marker pen or a sharpie, because it prevents you from focusing too much on detail. As you are sketching down your ideas, ask yourself these three questions:

-How can you organize the content to support your user's goals

-Which information should be most prominent?, Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?

-What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?

-Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired action?

### Add Some Detail and Get Testing

At this point your next step in the process would be to add some informational details to your wireframe for its upgrade, and get it to prototype mode. Your wireframe is still a skeleton at this point, so you want to start adding detail to it, and start building it up. Keep the following things in mind:

**-Usability** Conventions are things such as navigation bars, search boxes, etc. You want to figure out where on your web page you're going to place these things. 

-You want your wording or instructions to be simple and not overly complex for calls to action.

**-Trust building elements:** What do you need to build trust in your customers and where would you find these elements.

-Tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition.

At this point you are ready to start coducting user tests, which in most cases will be your own colleagues. Some tools that you can utilize during this testing period are **Usability Hub** to preference test screens and collect qualitative feedback, as well as **Prott**, which you can use to test and check the understanding of the basic user flow. With Prott, you can also photograph and upload your hand sketched wireframes, and then connect them to user button overlays. 

**Start Turning Your Wireframes into Prototypes**

Once you've analyzed all of your feedback from your first prototype, you can start building up your high fidelity prototype. During this phase you can utilize tools such as **Proto io, Adobe XD, Framer, Sketch, and Figma.** Sketch and Figma are the most well known, So, once you've developed your wireframes, you can import them into **InVision,** which is an industyr leading prototype tool. In the InVision tool you'll be able to interlink your screens for another round of high fidelity user testing. 

## How to Make Your Wireframe Good: Three Key Principals

### Clarity 

Your wireframe should answer the following questions: What the site page is, Waht the user can do there, Does your wireframe satisfy their needs. 

### Confidence

You want to make sure that your site page is easy enough to navigate and understand, by the users. If your site page design is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places, user confidence in your design will diminish. Ensuring that your site page is easy to navigate and clear calls to action options are available will increase user confidence in your brand. 

### Simplicity is Key

You want your users to be able to navigate their way through your site page design, with as little fancy stuff as possible. Having too much information, copy, or links can be distracting to the user, and this will have a negative affect on your user's ability to acheive their goals with their website.
