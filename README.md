## An Introduction to Wireframing

### What is a Wireframe

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers, which allows them to define, and plan a basic or rough sketch of a website, app or product, and the information hierarchy of their design. Before anything is built using code, you have to know where all the information is going to go, and how users are going to interact with your interface, through where you decide to position things, such as buttons, menus, pictures, and links on the diagrams. Wireframing enables you to plan the layout and interaction of your interface, without the distractions of colors, typeface choices, or text. 

### Wireframe Examples

How you design your wireframe is up to you, whether you decide to draw it by hand with pen and paper, or whether you decide to use software on your computer. So, before you start designing your own wireframe, it's a good idea to take a look at some wireframe examples, doing so will give you some ideas and inspiration for your own wireframes, the many variety of ways to create them, and which method you are the most comfortable with. However, beginners should keep in mind that, when designing a wireframe by drawing on paper or on a board, you have the advantage of being able to make changes more easily, and you'll pay more attention to detail later on when you switch to software. 

### Things to Consider Before You Start Wireframing

UX designers approach wireframing in different ways. Whether the decision is made to draw it by hand, or use online apps or tools, it's going to be more related to what approach the particular situation requires, as opposed to what the UX designer's preference is. What the situation requires is going to depend on how much emphasis there is on visual design of the project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what's being designed. If the task is little and the visual design has been either decided upon or is not that imortant, then it's fine to go from sketch to code. However, if the time, resources and business value are all high, then it's a good idea to make a high quality and high definition wireframe, and put it through a cycle of testing, before getting your final product.

## Six Steps to Make a Wireframe

### Do Your Research

It's important to keep in mind that UX Design is a process, and wireframing will not be your first step in the process, so before you start drawing out your wireframe by hand, it's important to have these two steps covered first: *understanding who your audience is by conducting research, detailing requirements, creating user personas, and defining use cases, also you would want to compliment this by conducting more industry and competitor research.* To briefly explain what this means, it means looking at and doing a deep analysis of product lines, that are similar to what you're trying to create, looking deeper into prevailing UX trends and best practices, and reviewing you own internal design guidelines. In the event that you happen to be designing a new feature, It would be a good idea to do some research outside of your domain, such as looking at other apps and getting some creative ideas from different fields of expertise, and where they intersect with yours.
